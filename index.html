                Hi, I am Saranya Vasudevan. I come from Belltown, Seattle. I am extremely passionate about software development. I was previously an android developer. I’ve always been skilled at bringing people together and working towards common goals. My experience successfully leading teams led me to take up full-stack software development as a full time career. </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I’ve been really enjoying other parts of my work like customer interaction and project management and I’m especially interested in bringing the experience I’ve gained as well as my commitment to improve efficiency of the team I shall work at. Outside of the office, I’m an avid reader and I love to hike. On weekends, you might find me at the local bookstore or exploring hiking trails in the area.   
            </p>
